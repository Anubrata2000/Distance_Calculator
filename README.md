# Distance Calculator App

## Description
The Distance Calculator App is a simple Android application developed using Android Studio. It calculates the distance between two points in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The user provides the x and y coordinates of the two points, and the app computes and displays the distance between them using the Euclidean distance formula.

## Features
- Calculate Distance: Enter the x and y coordinates of two points to calculate the distance between them.
- Euclidean Distance Formula: The app uses the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance accurately.

## Prerequisites
- Android Studio: You need to have Android Studio installed on your system to open and modify the project.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

## Usage
1. Launch the app on your Android device or emulator.
2. Enter the x and y coordinates of the two points.
3. Click the "Calculate Distance" button.
4. The app will display the calculated distance between the points.
